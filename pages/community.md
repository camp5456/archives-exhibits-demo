<p>Between 1910 and 1930, the undergraduate enrollment of Throop and Caltech grew from 34 to 533, with most students continuing to hail from Southern California. With more students came more shared interests, which in turn gave rise to new traditions and organizations.</p>

<p>While Throop’s Bulletin soberly explained that students were expected to have “serious purpose” and embrace the Institute’s “exceptionally good moral tone,” student life was energetic. Students performed in a glee club, orchestra, and band; organized chapters of professional organizations; and joined clubs centered on technical interests such as radio, aeronautics, and economics. The Associated Student Body published the weekly California Tech and Big T yearbook, administered the honor system, and organized social functions. The campus YMCA, founded in 1916, sponsored receptions, hikes, meetings, and classes, and formed a Cosmopolitan Club to bring together American and international students.</p>

<p>According to the Throop Catalogue, “wholesome forms of athletics are heartily encouraged,” but because “the daily work of the College is so important,” students could only devote limited time to sports. The Big T lamented the “non-athletic type of man which Tech draws to its doors,” but also celebrated the feats of Caltech’s teams in basketball, track, baseball, swimming, tennis, and especially football, “the backbone of college spirit and loyalty.”</p>

<p>Faculty and staff also created new social organizations. October 1930 marked the opening of the Athenaeum, a social club envisioned by George Ellery Hale for those affiliated with Caltech, Mount Wilson Observatory, and the Huntington Library.</p>
