<p>In the early 1910s, Throop devoted its efforts almost entirely to educating the next generation of mechanical and electrical engineers. Its leaders, particularly George Ellery Hale, had an additional aspiration: to make the school into a world-class science and engineering research institution as well.</p>

<p>Electrical engineer Royal Sorensen already had a laboratory in Pasadena Hall, laying the groundwork for high-voltage research to come. In 1913, Hale began a campaign to recruit chemist Arthur Amos Noyes from MIT. Noyes would become the first of several prominent scientists to bring a fresh field of study to campus. He was followed by physicist Robert Millikan, from the University of Chicago, and biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan, from Columbia University. Meanwhile, Albert A. Merrill and Harry Wood brought aeronautics and seismology to the institution, sparking research in fields that soon attracted renowned European scientists Theodore von Kármán and Beno Gutenberg. And while research in humanities and social sciences was scarce until the 1930s, faculty considered coursework in them essential to the education of well-rounded scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>Each new discipline was an occasion for a new building, and Throop and Caltech attracted researchers by promising architectural excellence. Celebrated architect Bertram Goodhue contributed to four buildings before his death in 1924, and his associates completed eleven more over the next fifteen years.</p>
